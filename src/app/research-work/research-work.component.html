                        Analysis on Lightning News and Correlation with Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) Data <br><br>
                        Abstract:  Due  to  the  geographic  location  of  Bangladesh,  heavy  rainfall  with  the
                        thunderstorm   is   a   common   phenomenon.   Every   year   lightning   causes   lots  
                        of casualties.  There are  very  few  sources  available  for  lightning-related  information.
                        Global  Hydrology  Resource  Centre  (GHRC) has a  huge  collection of lightning data from  1998 
                        to  April  2015.  The  other  source  of  lightning  is  the  news  incidents published in Newspapers.
                        This paper explores the  effects of lightning in Bangladesh during  the  last  several  years,  
                        by  analyzing  lightning  news  from  newspapers  and Lightning  Imaging  Sensor  (LIS)  data  from  
                        Global  Hydrology  Resource  Center (GHRC). We analyzed  LIS data  and  news data to  find the  
                        correlation between these datasets.  Finally,  we  report  lightning-prone  areas  with  time  when  
                        lightning  mostly occurs in Bangladesh based on those results. <br><br>
